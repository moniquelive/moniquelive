I'm a brazilian entrepreneur with a brief history at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) in Redmond, WA.

Currently working at [CyberLabs.ai](https://github.com/cyberlabsai) and having lots of fun with architectures to support AI platforms.

I've worked with different technologies during my 20+ years career. Currently I'm really enjoying working with [golang](https://github.com/topics/golang):

```go
Bio := struct {
  Pronouns,
  Undergrad,
  Also string
}{
  "👩🏻‍💻️ She/Her",
  "💾 Computer Engineer",
  "🔬 NLP Master Practitioner"
}
```

My previous companies: [21212.com](https://github.com/21212) and [Movile](https://github.com/Movile)
